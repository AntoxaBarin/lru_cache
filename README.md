# lru_cache
Simple implementation of cache policies - [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Policies:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,Least%20recently%20used%20(LRU),-%5Bedit%5D) and [Bit-PLRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-LRU). There is function `mmul()` that simulates processor access to memory. Cache only counts number of hits and misses and prints result.
